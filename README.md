<!-- About Me -->
## Cool Stuff About Me

```yaml

languages_I_can_KINDDA_use:
  - Python
  - TypeScript
  - C
  - Bash (for pretending I know what I'm doing)
  - SQL (just SELECT stuff and hope for the best)

stuff_I_like_doing:
  - Telling Theo I told you so
  - Doing anything but schoolwork
  - Pushing bugs into production servers
  - Writing code that somehow works but shouldn't
  - Debugging by deleting things randomly
  - Breaking stuff and calling it "feature testing"
  - Giving variables meaningful names like `x` and `stuff`

currently_learning:
  - How to dodge taxes
  - Writing secure code (after pushing exploits)
  - Why semicolons exist
  - The difference between TCP and UDP (again)
  - How to explain to HR why "Basically God" is in my GitHub profile

fun_facts:
  - I once fixed a bug by making the bug a feature
  - My debug strategy: print, panic, push
  - My threat model includes ducks with Wi-Fi
  - Catchphrase: “It works on my machine”

future_goals:
  - Avoid C# at all costs
  - Finally write a README that doesn’t insult someone
  - Get Theo to admit I was right (again)
